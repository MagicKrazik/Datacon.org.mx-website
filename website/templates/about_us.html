            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <!-- Story content here -->
            <p>Datacon.org.mx was born from a vision to revolutionize how small and medium-sized businesses leverage technology and data. Our founder's diverse background in economics, finance, accounting, and Python development laid the foundation for a unique approach to business consulting.</p>
            <p>After years of working across various industries - from banking and corporate finance to fintech and logistics - our founder noticed a common thread: businesses were struggling with outdated processes, lack of data visibility, and ill-fitting technology solutions. This realization sparked the idea for Datacon.org.mx.</p>
